# TryITJs Project

## Super simple

The simplest tryit project consists of a single file e.g.  [__demo.try__](docs/demo/demo.try) this consists of just a single file with no dependency on any other __.try__ file. You can include scriptsnfrom the web and other resources from the web (.css, .jpg ...) but no other files from your project directory.

The command will create [__demo.html__](docs/demo/demo.html) in the current directory.
