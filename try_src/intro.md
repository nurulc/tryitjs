    # TryITJS - What is it

    ## Problem statement

    ### Documenting JS Libraries

    #### API docs are hard to digest

    #### So Much To Read 

    We all know developers are bust, and documenting API is hard to do. Let's face it
    reading somebody else's code is hard particularly if the API is anyting other than small and simple.

    It is often harder to write documentation for a function than it is to write the function in the first place.
    Most often the doctment barely enough to even understant the simple usage of the API. But ther is one saving 
    grace - developers love to tinker with som code that is known to work.



    * Developers love to play with code
    * Make displaying data simple
